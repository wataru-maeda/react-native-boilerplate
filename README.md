## Core Features

<details>
  <summary><b>File-based Router</b></summary>
  
####

The project uses [**Expo Router**](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) with a pre-configured navigation structure which has updated from react-navigation. The navigation structure is based on file-based routing, making it easier to manage and navigate between screens. The project has a pre-configured navigation structure with a drawer and tab navigation. You can easily add new screens and navigations by following the existing structure:

```
Root (Drawer)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Home Tab
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Stack
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Home Screen
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Details Screen
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Profile Tab
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Stack
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Profile Screen
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Details Screen
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Global State Management</b></summary>

####

### State Management with Redux Toolkit
---

This project uses [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for global state management, pre-configured with Redux Hooks for immediate use. 

#### Getting Started
1. Explore existing slices in the [`/slices`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/tree/feat/expo-router/slices) directory
2. See usage examples in [`/app/_layout.tsx`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app/_layout.tsx#L23)

#### Adding New State
1. Copy [`/slices/app.slice.ts`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/slices/app.slice.ts)
2. Rename and modify for your needs
3. Add your slice to [`/utils/store.ts`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/utils/store.ts#L10)

#### Development
Redux logger is enabled by default. To disable, remove the logger from [`/utils/store.ts`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/utils/store.ts#L13).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Theme Management</b></summary>

####

The project simplifies asset and theme management through a centralized [`/theme`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/tree/feat/expo-router/theme) directory that handles images, icons, fonts, and colors, with built-in asset preloading and SVG support for optimal performance, while also providing a custom `useColorScheme` hook (located in [`/hooks/useColorScheme.ts`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/hooks/useColorScheme.ts)) that automatically detects and adapts colors based on the current theme across both mobile and web platforms - making it easy to implement dynamic theming by returning the current color scheme name and flags (isDark, isLight) for conditional styling.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Alias Paths</b></summary>

####

The project uses absolute imports to simplify development by replacing complex relative paths (like `../../../components/Button`) with cleaner paths (like `@/components/elements/Button`), configured in [`tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/tsconfig.json#L6-L8) for hassle-free navigation through deeply nested project structures.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Environment Variables</b></summary>

####

### Environment Variables Management

The project uses [`dotenvx`](https://dotenvx.com/) to handle environment variables across both Expo CLI and EAS CLI builds. Here's how it works:

#### Setup Structure
- `.env.dev.example` - Development environment template
- `.env.prod.example` - Production environment template
- Configuration in [`app.config.ts`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app.config.ts) and [`utils/config.ts`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/utils/config.ts)

#### Getting Started with Your Expo Account
1. Copy `.env.dev.example` to `.env.dev`
2. Update `owner` in [`app.json`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app.json#L6) with your Expo username
3. Set your `EXPO_SLUG` and `EXPO_PROJECT_ID` in `.env.dev`

#### Adding New Environment Variables
1. Add variables to both `.env.dev` and `.env.prod`
2. Include them in `app.config.ts` under the [`extra`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app.config.ts#L29) object
3. Define them in [`utils/config.ts`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/utils/config.ts#L6)

#### Verify Configuration
- Check variables in the app's bottom sheet OR...
- Run `npm run dev:config:public` to view loaded variables in console

### Environment Variables & Security

The project intentionally avoids using `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables, instead utilizing EAS secrets for enhanced security. Here's why:

#### Current Approach
- Variables are uploaded to EAS servers as `secrets`
- Securely accessible only during EAS build and submit processes
- Use `npm run dev:secret:push` to automatically upload variables from `.env.dev` and `.env.prod`

#### Alternative Approach
If you prefer direct access via `process.env`:
- Use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for non-sensitive data
- **Warning**: Never store sensitive information with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix as it exposes data to clients
- For sensitive data handling, follow [React Native's security guidelines](https://reactnative.dev/docs/security#storing-sensitive-info) for storing sensitive information

<details>
  <summary><b>Distribution</b></summary>

####

- The project is equipped with a streamlined distribution process for both mobile and web platforms. Here's how you can deploy your app to various platforms:

1. **Mobile Distribution**
- Run `npm run dev:build:mobile` to build the app distribution for iOS and Android.
- The build process generates an APK file for Android and an IPA file for iOS, which can be used for further testing or deployment.

2. **Web Distribution**
- Run `npm run dev:deploy:web` to build and deploy the web application to [EAS Hosting](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/hosting/introduction/).
- The deployment process is configured to leverage GitHub Pages, ensuring a seamless and efficient deployment experience.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>[CI] Code formatting, linting and testing on pre-commit</b></summary>

####

- Configurations for Eslint, Prettier, and Jest have been meticulously established to ensure your code remains clean and adheres to best practices. Here's a breakdown of how these tools enhance your development workflow:
1. Throughout the coding process, these integrated tools proactively scan and refine your code. Activating the 'Format on Save' feature further streamlines this process, automatically tidying your code with each save.
2. Committing changes triggers a pre-commit script that meticulously checks, formats, and tests your code. This comprehensive review process ensures your contributions are both error-free and stylistically consistent.
3. Successfully navigating through the stages of code verification, formatting, and testing empowers you to commit your changes with absolute confidence. You can rest assured knowing your code is not only efficient but also meets the highest standards of quality and reliability.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>[CD] Release previews on Pull-Request (only mobile)</b></summary>

####

- When you've completed your work and need to share a preview with the QA team, our boilerplate automates the distribution process for you. Here's how it works:
1. Whenever you create a pull request (PR) or merge, it automatically generates a preview channel in your Expo account.
2. You don't need to run 'eas' commands every time you create a PR; the process is streamlined for you.
3. The continuous delivery (CD) process is managed through the [preview.yml](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview.yml) configuration file, which utilizes [expo-github-action](https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action).

To set up the CD workflow, follow these steps:
1. Create an `EXPO_TOKEN` in your Expo account. You can do this by visiting [this link](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/settings/access-tokens).
2. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings**, then navigate to **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions** -> **Add new repository secret**. Make sure to name the secret as `EXPO_TOKEN`.
3. Update `name`, `slug`, `owner`, `projectId` and `url` in [app.json](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/main/app.json):
4. Update in `name`, `slug`, `projectId`, `ios`, `android` in [app.config.ts](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/main/app.config.ts)
6. After you push changes to the main branch, a new preview will be created automatically.
