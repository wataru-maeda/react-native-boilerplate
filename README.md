## ü§ñ What's included


<details>
  <summary><b>File-based Router</b></summary>
  
####

The project has updated from react-navigation to `expo-router`, utilizing it for stack, tab, and drawer navigation configurations. 

The navigation structure consists of a [drawer](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app/(main)/(tabs)/home/_layout.tsx) that wraps two Tabs ([home tab](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app/(main)/(tabs)/home/_layout.tsx) and [profile tab](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app/(main)/(tabs)/profile/_layout.tsx)). The Home tab contains [stack](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app/(main)/(tabs)/home/_layout.tsx) navigation for moving between home and details pages, while the Profile tab has Stack navigation for accessing profile and settings pages. This navigation system is designed to be both intuitive and highly customizable to suit specific requirements.

  <summary><b>Global State Management</b></summary>

####

Global state is quite important for app state management. The project uses Redux Toolkit for global state management. The project has pre-configured Redux Toolkit with Redux Hooks for immediate use. You can easily set up Redux Hooks by reviewing under [slices](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/tree/feat/expo-router/slices) directory. The application of Redux Hooks example (how to read and write) can be found in [root layout](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app/_layout.tsx#L23)

To add a new slice, you can copy and past [app.slice.ts](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/slices/app.slice.ts) under slices directory and rename it. Then you can add the slice to the [store](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/utils/store.ts#L10)

In development environment, redux logger is enabled by default. If you want to disable the feature, remove the logger from [store.ts](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/utils/store.ts#L13)

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Centralized Theme</b></summary>

####

This project centralizes the management of theme, including images, icons, fonts, colors within the [theme directory](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/main/src/theme). For seamless integration of new assets, ensure their importation into the designated files where they will be utilized. This approach facilitates streamlined access to all assets via the theme structure.
To further optimize performance, asset preloading has been incorporated into the boilerplate. This setup also supports the use of SVG files, offering extensive flexibility in managing visual resources. Assets are made effortlessly accessible for implementation across the project by importing them directly from the theme.

Also, The project initially setup with color schema hook which you can easily detect the current theme from the book. Switch color based on the theme. You can import [`useColorScheme`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/hooks/useColorScheme.ts) hook which adapt both mobile and web. The hook return the current color scheme name and flag (isDark, isLight). So it's easy to switch the color based on the theme.

<details>
  <summary><b>Alias Paths</b></summary>

####

Navigating through complex project architectures with deeply nested folders often complicates the use of relative paths, potentially leading to errors. To alleviate this issue, our boilerplate simplifies the development process by facilitating the use of absolute paths. This means you can replace convoluted relative paths like `../../../components/Button` with straightforward references such as `@/components/elements/Button` in your import statements.
The implementation for this feature is configured within [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/tsconfig.json#L6-L8) files. These configurations ensure a hassle-free experience in utilizing absolute paths across your project, enhancing clarity and reducing the likelihood of path-related errors.

<details>
  <summary><b>Environment Variables</b></summary>

####

The project use [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/) to load environment variables into the project. Currently Expo and EAS CLI has different behavior when it comes to environment variables. Expo CLI loads `.env` file but EAS CLI doesn't load `.env` file. So we decided to use external env variable library like `dotenvx` to adjust both cases.

The project has pre-configured environment variables for development, and production environments which you can find in [.env.dev.example](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/.env.dev.example) and [.env.production.example](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/.env.prod.example). The configuration allows you to have separate expo project accounts for development and production environments.

To use your own expo project account in development environment for example,
1. Rename .env.dev.example to .env.dev
2. Update `owner` in [app.json](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app.json#L6) to your expo user name
3. Update `EXPO_SLUG` and `EXPO_PROJECT_ID` in .env.dev file at least

Now all ready to use your own expo project account in development environment.

To add new environment variables to use in your app, you can take 3 steps
1. Add new env variables to the `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` files
2. Load the new env variables in the app.config.ts file, Add them in the [`extra`](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/app.config.ts#L27-L29) object
3. Add new env variables in [config.ts](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/utils/config.ts#L4-L10)

Once you successfully added the new environments, you'll see at the [bottom sheet](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/feat/expo-router/components/layouts/BottomSheetContents/BottomSheetContents.tsx#L82-L86) of the app. 

Or check by the command `npm run dev:config:public`. You can see the loaded environment variables in the console.

example:
```
{
...
  extra: {
    env: 'development',
    apiUrl: 'https://example.com',
    eas: {
      projectId: '18adc0d0-eb1d-11e9-8009-d524ed5cc4a7'
    },
    router: {
      origin: false
    }
  },
  androidStatusBar: {
    backgroundColor: '#ffffff'
  }
}
```

Some may consider the project is not using `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables which is one of the way to access the env variable in client from process.env property. This is because we use .env files to upload the env variables to EAS servers as [`secret`](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/environment-variables/#visibility). Secret cannot include `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix. Once you upload the variables to EAS server, those are only readable in EAS servers which mean you can securely read the variables in [EAS build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) and [EAS submit](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction/). You can upload the variables to EAS servers from .env.dev and .env.prod files to EAS servers by running `npm run dev:secret:push` so that you do not need to manually upload the variables to EAS servers.

If you are not intend to use the pre-structured env variable flow, you can use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix to easily access env variables from process.env property. But please do not store any sensitive information with the prefix. Otherwise it will be exposed to client. For comprehensive guidelines on securely managing sensitive data, refer to the recommendations provided in [storing sensitive info](https://reactnative.dev/docs/security#storing-sensitive-info).

  <summary><b>[CI] Code formatting, linting and testing on pre-commit</b></summary>

####

- Configurations for Eslint, Prettier, and Jest have been meticulously established to ensure your code remains clean and adheres to best practices. Here's a breakdown of how these tools enhance your development workflow:
1. Throughout the coding process, these integrated tools proactively scan and refine your code. Activating the 'Format on Save' feature further streamlines this process, automatically tidying your code with each save.
2. Committing changes triggers a pre-commit script that meticulously checks, formats, and tests your code. This comprehensive review process ensures your contributions are both error-free and stylistically consistent.
3. Successfully navigating through the stages of code verification, formatting, and testing empowers you to commit your changes with absolute confidence. You can rest assured knowing your code is not only efficient but also meets the highest standards of quality and reliability.

<details>
  <summary><b>[CD] Release previews on Pull-Request (only mobile)</b></summary>

####

- When you've completed your work and need to share a preview with the QA team, our boilerplate automates the distribution process for you. Here's how it works:
1. Whenever you create a pull request (PR) or merge, it automatically generates a preview channel in your Expo account.
2. You don't need to run 'eas' commands every time you create a PR; the process is streamlined for you.
3. The continuous delivery (CD) process is managed through the [preview.yml](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview.yml) configuration file, which utilizes [expo-github-action](https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action).

To set up the CD workflow, follow these steps:
1. Create an `EXPO_TOKEN` in your Expo account. You can do this by visiting [this link](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/settings/access-tokens).
2. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings**, then navigate to **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions** -> **Add new repository secret**. Make sure to name the secret as `EXPO_TOKEN`.
3. Update `name`, `slug`, `owner`, `projectId` and `url` in [app.json](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/main/app.json):
4. Update in `name`, `slug`, `projectId`, `ios`, `android` in [app.config.ts](https://github.com/wataru-maeda/react-native-boilerplate/blob/main/app.config.ts)
6. After you push changes to the main branch, a new preview will be created automatically.
